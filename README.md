Native version of [Elk](https://github.com/elk-zone/elk), a nimble Mastodon web client.

Elk Native is even more early alpha than the web version, but we would love your feedback and contributions. If you would like to help us with testing, feedback, or contributing, join our [discord](https://chat.elk.zone) and get involved.

# Contributing

We're really excited that you're interested in contributing to Elk! Please read through the small guide below to get started:

> Note: 
> <br>
> This repo only holds the code necessary for the native app and just git-submodules the frontend from https://github.com/elk-zone/elk so please submit Issues and PRs concerning the frontend there! 

## Local Setup

First you will need to install Rust and other system dependencies required for developing a Tauri app, you can follow [this guide](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites).

Next, you need to install the Tauri CLI which is used to orchestrate the build and package up the final app:

```sh
cargo install tauri-cli
# or
npm install -g @tauri-apps/cli
# or 
pnpm install -g @tauri-apps/cli
# or
yarn add -g @tauri-apps/cli
```

Now clone the submodule in the `elk` folder.

```
git submodule update --init elk
```

Next install the frontend dependencies:

```
cd elk && pnpm i
```

Then you can run the app in development mode:

```
cargo tauri dev
```

To create a production build of the app:

```
cargo tauri build
```

## Logging

This app uses a unified logging stream that encompasses both logs from the Rust Core as well as from the frontend. Log levels and filters can be set through the `RUST_LOG` environment variable (this also works in a release mode app).

For more information on how to specify log levels and filters see [the env_logger docs](https://docs.rs/env_logger/latest/env_logger/index.html).
