Native version of Elk, a nimble Mastodon web client.

Elk Native is even more early alpha than the web version, but we would love your feedback and contributions.

The web client code lives at https://github.com/elk-zone/elk, a repository that will be open-sourced once we are ready to promote the app widely. If you would like to help us with testing, feedback, or contributing, join our [discord](https://chat.elk.zone) and get involved.

# Contributing

We're really excited that you're interested in contributing to Elk! Please read through the small guide below to get started:

> Note: 
> <br>
> This repo only holds the code necessary for the native app and just git-submodules the frontend from https://github.com/elk-zone/elk so please submit Issues and PRs concerning the frontend there! 

## Local Setup

> NOTE: This branch depends on the currently WIP Tauri mobile branch, you should [follow the steps here](https://next--tauri.netlify.app/next/guides/getting-started/prerequisites) to set up a local development environment including XCode and Android Studio

First you will need to install Rust and other system dependencies required for developing a Tauri app, you can follow [this guide](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites).

Next, you need to install the Tauri CLI which is used to orchestrate the build and package up the final app:

```sh
cargo install tauri-cli
# or
npm install -g @tauri-apps/cli
# or 
pnpm install -g @tauri-apps/cli
# or
yarn add -g @tauri-apps/cli
```

Now clone the submodule in the `elk` folder.

```
git submodule update --init elk
```

Next install the frontend dependencies:

```
cd elk && pnpm i
```

Then you can run the app in development mode:

```
cargo tauri dev
```

To create a production build of the app:

```
cargo tauri build
```

## Logging

This app uses a unified logging stream that encompasses both logs from the Rust Core as well as from the frontend. Log levels and filters can be set through the `RUST_LOG` environment variable (this also works in a release mode app).

For more information on how to specify log levels and filters see [the env_logger docs](https://docs.rs/env_logger/latest/env_logger/index.html).
